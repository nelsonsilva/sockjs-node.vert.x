# connect.vert.x

This is a simple [connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) clone for [vert.x](vertx.io)

## Prerequisites
node.js
npm
cake

## Running
`npm install`

`cake build`

`cake vert.x`  This will run a 'hello world' sample

## Notes

Most of it is written in CoffeeScript just because...

The router middleware was extracted from an older connect version.
